Good day Vitali
Hope everything goes well with you.
For one other project I need to buy a Vazha license if it meet my requirement
Near the main road with 20-30 meter distance I want install 2 cameras to cover both ways and count the heavy cars only
We don’t need plate number or details for now
Just counting and export the reports in excel or pdf format
#### 13:31 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych

Hello, Amin. Nice to hear from you! I'm doing really well and hope you are too.
I think we could use the Traffic Analytics module here. It allows you to draw a line in the frame and count objects of specific types that cross it.
#### 13:32 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
And then we can draw statistics in VEZHA or export it in csv, which can be easily converted into xlsx
#### 13:44 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Btw, any news from Georgian Railroads?
#### 13:45 — ~Amin
**type:** text
I’m following them and we are preparing the quotation for them.
The issue is that they are really lazy as governmental organization and they want do nothing
We have to calculate tones of details for them😀
#### 13:48 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Any help from us that could speed up the process?
#### 13:49 — ~Amin
**type:** text
At the moment no and I hope soon we can finalize the financial step with them
#### 14:06 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
