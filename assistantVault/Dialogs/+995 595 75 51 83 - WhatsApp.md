Hi Vitalii
Could you share the Hardware Requirements for Nikora?
I could use a calculator, but I think the requirements from your side will work well

**type:** text
For this amount of analytics Server type is preferable
#### 12:33 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Desktop is good for demo or small projects
#### 12:34 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
But here you have 300 analytics. So, better use server
#### 12:34 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Everything else is correct
#### 12:34 — ~Tony
**type:** text
got it!
#### 12:34 — ~Tony
**type:** text
i think so
#### 12:34 — ~Tony
**type:** text
it was jus t question from my collegues
#### 12:37 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Also, I'm not sure about 4 MP resolution. It's great that we have such a quality, but if camera is on the entrance of the supermarket and observing people from 2-4 meters distance, 2 MP could be enough.
And this way we will reduce amount of recourses that we need for processing VA.
*But if camera is far from faces, better leave 4 MP. Quality is priority.*
#### 12:41 — ~Tony
**type:** text
I think I will propose a 2 mp camera with a varifocal. And the ceiling is high, therefore I will also need a bracket, and I need to set it up in a way that it has a good view of the people entering through the doors
#### 12:41 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Could work well

Vitalii one more question
Regarding this storage,
If I want to save the faces for up to 1 year, I have to multiply it by 365 days. right?
#### 18:29 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Yep
#### 18:29 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
You need to save all the results of the recognition for a year?
#### 18:33 — ~Tony
**type:** text
What is the best experience  ?
#### 19:07 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Usualy no one needs more than 30 days. But it's up to you. <This message was edited>

If the thief comes back after 1 year, what will happen in that case? I’m asking this because a thief may steal in one branch and then return after some period of time, for example after 3–4 months. And if I store the face image for only 1 month, does that mean that from the second month I will no longer be able to recognize him?
#### 14:37 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
You can add recognized people to the lists. Black list, for example to identify them in the future
#### 14:37 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
No need to store all the detections
#### 14:37 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Just pick one of the interest.
#### 14:39 — ~Tony
**type:** text
understood, I will keep that in mind
#### 14:39 — ~Tony
**type:** text
thank you
#### 14:42 — ~Tony

Does the system need to be renewed after one year? I mean, is the subscription annual or is it perpetual?
#### 14:42 — ~Tony
**type:** text
this is for NIKORA
#### 14:44 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
One time license. No subscription. You need to pay additionally after 1 year of usage if you want to install a new version with new functionality. But if the present functionality is ok for you, no need to pay.
#### 14:44 — ~Tony
