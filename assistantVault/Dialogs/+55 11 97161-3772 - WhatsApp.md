For now, I’ve only gathered all the requirements in one place. If you confirm that everything you need is there, we can schedule a long call to discuss each point in detail.
After that, I’ll present these changes to our top management and advocate for them.
#### 15:01 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych

Hello, Danial. Did you check which mother boards do these servers have? Do we need to change them?
#### 17:17 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Hi Vitalli, I´m checking with the manufacturer. I had a meeting with PNY and they will give the best way to buy GPU´s in Brazil.
#### 17:17 — ~Daniel Pegorer

**type:** text
Hello. PNY definitely has cards we need: https://www.pny.com/GeForce-RTX-2080-Ti-11GB-Blower2
The question is do they have these cards in required amount (we need 2 per server, so 14 total).
Also we can use 3090, which will give us even more recourses: https://www.pny.com/pny-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-24gb-xlr8-gaming-uprising-epic-x-rgb-overclocked-triple-fan
If we choose 3090, we'll need only 1 GPU per server, so, no need to change motherboard. <This message was edited>
#### 10:15 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
From my research, one 3090 costs almost the same as two 2080 TI.
#### 10:16 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
If these options isn't ok for you, I'll try to come up with something else.
#### 10:18 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Please, remind me the hardware budget (it's 5800 usd per server if I remember correctly)? And if 2 servers are already installed, that leaves us $40600 for the remaining ones.
Tell me is it correct?
#### 10:22 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
I'm also waiting for your feedback regarding requirements document.
#### 12:25 — ~Daniel Pegorer

We have to choose from the cards in that pdf?
#### 12:53 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych

Thank you for a feedback!)
#### 12:56 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
About the machines to Hospital, unfortunately the machine will not accept two boards. It is a limitation to I9, I don´t know why.
We have conditions just to change the board that we have there and for the new machines.
I just need to know which board will be better to handle all system. I will try to change all boards.
#### 12:57 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
We can go with one GPU if 3090 will be ok.
#### 12:59 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Give more options because I will analyse comparing pricing. PNY gave idea about some prices and belive in me, now we have how to buy something better. I know the way.
#### 13:19 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
We need 10k cuda cores and 18GB vram per server.
These cards have such params:
RTX 3090
RTX 3090 Ti
RTX 4090
RTX A6000
NVIDIA A40
#### 13:20 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
But I’m telling you, 3090 — is the best choice in matter cost/power balance.
#### 13:40 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
OK. I'm asking because here you can find more RTX5xxx or RTX6xxx
#### 13:41 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
RTX 3090TI with x G?
#### 14:09 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
RTX 3090 Ti always comes with 24 GB
#### 14:10 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Any of these will be excellent
1.	RTX 5000 Ada (32 GB)
2.	RTX 6000 Ada (48 GB)
3.	RTX A5500 (24 GB)
4.	RTX A6000 (48 GB)
#### 14:32 — ~Daniel Pegorer

Hello Vitalli, I'm traveling to visit some customers in Chile. Sorry about my delay.
#### 20:34 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
About Hospital, so, 3090TI 24G will be the best option about price x resources, right?
### 2025-12-17
#### 14:57 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Hi Vitalli, you are really sick. Take care my friend.
#### 23:15 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Hi Vitalli, I need that you confirm which GPU you prefer at this moment to Hospital machines.
This RTX3090 20G is not easy to find here.
Let me know if you prefer RTX A4500 20G or RTX 4070 SUPER 12G
### 2025-12-18
#### 14:57 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Hi Vitalli, are you okay?
### 2025-12-19
#### 15:14 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Hi. Much better now. What about you?
#### 15:18 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
RTX A4500 20G good, but better to find RTX A5500 24 G. This extra 4 GB per card mean a lot.
#### 15:19 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
This comparison doesn't matter as we have twice less VRAM
#### 16:11 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
4500 20G was something that I got changing the machines. A5500 24G has a huge difference in prices.
#### 16:12 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Understood
#### 16:12 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Well, if there is nothing we can do, let's go with 4500

Hello, Danial! How are you? How was your holidays?) I remember, we had great plans on this quarter. Are there any updates? Maybe you need help with something?
### 2026-01-16
#### 16:32 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Hi Vitalli. I´m doing great and I hope the same for you and your family.
We need to go forward with Banco de la nacion.
I´m working with Axxon yet, unfortunately because we didn´t solve that questions about object tracker with CPU and you told there is no plan to do it. Believe or not, I´m fighting with a lot of brazilians companies and they are doing.
So, I don´t know how to go forward, I´m totally lost.
#### 16:32 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Machines to hospital, I have changed the GPU to RTXA4500 20G. We will delivery 2 x servers next week
#### 16:34 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
I remember we planned to use edge analytics for the bank project.
Do you remember me mentioning that our VMS can receive data directly from the cameras?
#### 16:35 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Sounds great!
#### 16:38 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Yes, I remember. Is it ready?
#### 17:30 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Should be ready in February
#### 17:32 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
From what year? It doesn't hurt to ask.
#### 17:32 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
Hahah. No, I'm telling you, it's almost ready
#### 17:32 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych

As well as mobile application
#### 17:34 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
Cool, very cool.
And did you guys get approval from the bank in Mexico?
#### 17:40 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
But, you know, receiving the payment would help speed things up)
#### 17:40 — Vitalii Kazymyrovych
**type:** text
we are top company from the last 3. its taking more time but we Will get it. ISS, Avigilon and Us in the final round
#### 17:43 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
I never said you should do things for free, because these are things we are already paying Axxon for, but unfortunately, the resources you need for simple things are greater. That is the point at issue.
#### 17:43 — ~Daniel Pegorer
**type:** text
I´m praying for your company.
