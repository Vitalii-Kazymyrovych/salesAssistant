[01.12.2025, 09:46:43] ~Tony: Hi Vitalii

Could you share the Hardware Requirements for Nikora? 
I could use a calculator, but I think the requirements from your side will work well
‎[01.12.2025, 12:06:59] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Calculator result (13).pdf • ‎1 page ‎<attached: 00000034-Calculator result (13).pdf>
‎[01.12.2025, 12:21:31] ~Tony: ‎<attached: 00000035-PHOTO-2025-12-01-12-21-31.jpg>
[01.12.2025, 12:21:47] ~Tony: this config is as Desktop  Type
[01.12.2025, 12:22:03] ~Tony: is it correct ?
[01.12.2025, 12:22:09] ~Tony: could you take a look ?
[01.12.2025, 12:22:55] ~Tony: ‎This message was deleted.
[01.12.2025, 12:33:29] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: For this amount of analytics Server type is preferable
[01.12.2025, 12:33:53] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Desktop is good for demo or small projects
[01.12.2025, 12:34:06] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: But here you have 300 analytics. So, better use server
[01.12.2025, 12:34:22] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Everything else is correct
[01.12.2025, 12:34:22] ~Tony: got it!
[01.12.2025, 12:34:29] ~Tony: i think so
[01.12.2025, 12:34:38] ~Tony: it was jus t question from my collegues
[01.12.2025, 12:37:18] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Also, I'm not sure about 4 MP resolution. It's great that we have such a quality, but if camera is on the entrance of the supermarket and observing people from 2-4 meters distance, 2 MP could be enough. 

And this way we will reduce amount of recourses that we need for processing VA. 

*But if camera is far from faces, better leave 4 MP. Quality is priority.*
[01.12.2025, 12:41:01] ~Tony: I think I will propose a 2 mp camera with a varifocal. And the ceiling is high, therefore I will also need a bracket, and I need to set it up in a way that it has a good view of the people entering through the doors
[01.12.2025, 12:41:52] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Could work well
[01.12.2025, 13:27:11] ~Tony: ‎This message was deleted.
‎[01.12.2025, 14:13:02] ~Tony: Vitalii one more question 

Regarding this storage, 
If I want to save the faces for up to 1 year, I have to multiply it by 365 days. right? ‎<attached: 00000051-PHOTO-2025-12-01-14-13-02.jpg>
[01.12.2025, 18:29:07] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Yep
[01.12.2025, 18:29:26] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: You need to save all the results of the recognition for a year?
[01.12.2025, 18:33:15] ~Tony: What is the best experience  ?
[01.12.2025, 19:07:41] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Usualy no one needs more than 30 days. But it's up to you. ‎<This message was edited>
[02.12.2025, 14:36:19] ~Tony: If the thief comes back after 1 year, what will happen in that case? I’m asking this because a thief may steal in one branch and then return after some period of time, for example after 3–4 months. And if I store the face image for only 1 month, does that mean that from the second month I will no longer be able to recognize him?
[02.12.2025, 14:37:21] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: You can add recognized people to the lists. Black list, for example to identify them in the future
[02.12.2025, 14:37:33] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: No need to store all the detections
[02.12.2025, 14:37:43] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Just pick one of the interest.
[02.12.2025, 14:39:36] ~Tony: understood, I will keep that in mind
[02.12.2025, 14:39:40] ~Tony: thank you
[02.12.2025, 14:42:12] ~Tony: Does the system need to be renewed after one year? I mean, is the subscription annual or is it perpetual?
[02.12.2025, 14:42:18] ~Tony: this is for NIKORA
[02.12.2025, 14:44:12] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: One time license. No subscription. You need to pay additionally after 1 year of usage if you want to install a new version with new functionality. But if the present functionality is ok for you, no need to pay.
[02.12.2025, 14:44:41] ~Tony: got it
[02.12.2025, 14:44:45] ~Tony: thanks
