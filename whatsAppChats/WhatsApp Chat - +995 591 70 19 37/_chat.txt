[30.05.2025, 10:57:57] ~Amin: Good day Vitali
Hope everything goes well with you.
For one other project I need to buy a Vazha license if it meet my requirement 
Near the main road with 20-30 meter distance I want install 2 cameras to cover both ways and count the heavy cars only
We don’t need plate number or details for now
Just counting and export the reports in excel or pdf format
‎[30.05.2025, 13:31:42] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Hello, Amin. Nice to hear from you! I'm doing really well and hope you are too.

I think we could use the Traffic Analytics module here. It allows you to draw a line in the frame and count objects of specific types that cross it. ‎<attached: 00000008-PHOTO-2025-05-30-13-31-42.jpg>
‎[30.05.2025, 13:32:45] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: And then we can draw statistics in VEZHA or export it in csv, which can be easily converted into xlsx ‎<attached: 00000009-PHOTO-2025-05-30-13-32-45.jpg>
