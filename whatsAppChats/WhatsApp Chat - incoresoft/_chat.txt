[20.01.2026, 10:34:01] ~ Tornike: I don’t have any questions for now, but I think I’ll have some tomorrow.
[26.01.2026, 11:45:17] ~ Tornike: Hello,

The system is able to successfully detect faces in the live camera feed
however, it does not match detected faces with the photos that were previously provided and enrolled in the system.
We also added photos that were taken directly by the system itself to the reference list, but the system still does not recognize or match the person
Is there anything we can do?
‎[26.01.2026, 11:47:01] ~ Tornike: this is photo i added manually to list. ‎<attached: 00000324-PHOTO-2026-01-26-11-47-01.jpg>
‎[26.01.2026, 11:47:34] ~ Tornike: These are the photos that the system did not match. ‎<attached: 00000325-PHOTO-2026-01-26-11-47-34.jpg>
‎[26.01.2026, 11:51:58] ~ Tornike: also this button does not work. ‎<attached: 00000326-PHOTO-2026-01-26-11-51-58.jpg>
‎[26.01.2026, 12:03:27] ~ Tornike: ok i think problem was because list was not connected to camera ‎<attached: 00000327-PHOTO-2026-01-26-12-03-27.jpg>
[26.01.2026, 13:01:59] ~ Tornike: it appears to be working well on our side.

Could you please send us your commercial offer?
[26.01.2026, 13:02:02] ~ Tornike: @⁨Зураб⁩
[26.01.2026, 13:02:18] Зураб: Hi Tornike
[26.01.2026, 13:02:35] Зураб: how many cameras are we planning to connect now?
[26.01.2026, 13:03:40] Зураб: i remember we spoke about 10-15 previously but not sure
[26.01.2026, 13:05:48] ~ Tornike: as i remember it was 3 
But i will double check.
[26.01.2026, 13:06:29] ~ Tornike: we want only 1 for now.
[26.01.2026, 13:07:05] Зураб: ok understood
‎[26.01.2026, 13:19:42] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Hello, Tornike. The first thing to do to improve recognition is to upload photos to the list according to the documentation. 

Check this manual: https://docs.incoresoft.com/ivig/latest/face-recognition-camera-installation-94609150.html

It also contains plenty of helpful tips on how to adjust cameras. ‎<attached: 00000336-PHOTO-2026-01-26-13-19-42.jpg>
[26.01.2026, 13:21:05] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Do I understand correctly: the person was recognized several times, but matched against the list only once?
[26.01.2026, 13:32:42] ~ Tornike: Nო
[26.01.2026, 13:32:45] ~ Tornike: No
[26.01.2026, 13:33:09] ~ Tornike: problem was because list was not connected to camera
‎[26.01.2026, 13:33:28] ~ Tornike: ‎<attached: 00000341-PHOTO-2026-01-26-13-33-28.jpg>
[26.01.2026, 13:33:31] ~ Tornike: now its working fine.
[26.01.2026, 13:34:38] ~ Tornike: and problem is that we cannot upload according to the documentation because we have bad quality photos in our system.
but i think its working fine now.
[26.01.2026, 14:11:49] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Ok, understood. ‎<This message was edited>
