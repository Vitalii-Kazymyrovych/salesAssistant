Hello Marko,
My name is Vitalii, and I’m the Regional Sales Manager at Incoresoft. We are definitely interested in participating in this project.

Below is how our software aligns with the project’s requirements:

Analytics Functionalities (for all connected cameras):
Server-based video analytics — Compliant ✅
Face blurring (on export) — Compliant ✅
Appearance search — Compliant ✅
Smoke/Fire detection (including on thermal cameras) — Partially Compliant 🟡
    (Our software detects smoke and fire but does not currently support integration with thermal cameras.)
Traffic/People counting — Compliant ✅
Differentiation of object types — Compliant ✅
Event detection (e.g., crossing a boundary) — Compliant ✅

AI Functionalities:
AI-driven analytics rule creation (voice or text-based) with real-time event alerting — Partially Compliant 🟡
    (We offer a flexible rule-creation interface, but it does not support voice or text input.)
Real-time alerts for smoke/fire, perimeter breaches, personal safety (e.g., falls, robbery) — Compliant ✅

Please note that we provide only the video analytics solution. All VMS functionality is delivered through Milestone, which we integrate seamlessly with.

We are ready to sign an NDA and work closely with you to win this project.

If you need any additional information or would like to discuss a potential partnership, I’d be happy to arrange a call next week.

Resellers? Competitors? Local laws? Political situation? Opened tenders? Everything seems important enough to begin with.

[15.01.2026, 14:05:56] ~Xavier Miota: Hello what is the situation with MUK?
[15.01.2026, 14:16:05] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Hello. Waiting for logs from the end user. Can't say what the issue is until I get them.
[15.01.2026, 14:22:31] ~Xavier Miota: Ok
[15.01.2026, 14:23:33] ~Xavier Miota: One thing is the first black screen is worrying
[15.01.2026, 14:25:17] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Black screen means that we don’t have video from camera. We successfully connected it but can’t see video stream
[15.01.2026, 14:27:28] ~Xavier Miota: Ok
[15.01.2026, 14:29:51] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: The problem is that the PC is in the customer's local network, and neither I nor Yuriy can connect to it.
[15.01.2026, 14:30:18] ~Xavier Miota: Understood
[15.01.2026, 15:40:15] Vitalii Kazymyrovych: Paulo needs 6 channels of saas to be moved to customer's on premice server. He will continue to pay regularly for the software but will have it working on his server. 

But Paulo doesn't have separate 6 FR license to just move it to a new server. How can we solve this situation?
[15.01.2026, 15:42:10] ~Xavier Miota: Make 6 demo channels FR for 90 days
[15.01.2026, 15:42:23] ~Xavier Miota: Put SAAS in description
